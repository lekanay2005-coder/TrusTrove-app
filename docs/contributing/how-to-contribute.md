# How to Contribute

TrusTrove is open source and actively looking for contributors through the
Stellar Wave program on Drips.

### Find an issue

- [TrusTrove-app issues](https://github.com/TrusTrove/TrusTrove-app/issues)
- [TrusTrove-contract issues](https://github.com/TrusTrove/TrusTrove-contract/issues)
